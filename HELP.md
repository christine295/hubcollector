# HubCollector — Help & Reference

## How it works

Each hub has a permanent URL at `/h/[username]/[slug]`. You print a QR code pointing to that URL and attach it to something physical — a product, an artwork, a piece of equipment, a property, a vehicle, or any physical space. The content behind the QR can be updated at any time without reprinting.

**Hub modes:**
- **Interactive Page** (`landing`) — A full content page with text, images, audio, links, checklists, timelines, and more. Visitors can interact directly — tapping links, playing audio, checking off items.
- **Redirect Link** (`redirect`) — Instantly sends visitors to another URL. No page is shown; the QR code acts as a permanent shortcut to any external link.

**Privacy levels:**
- `public` — Anyone can find and view
- `unlisted` — Only people with the link can view
- `private` — Only the owner when signed in

---

## Engagement metrics

Every public hub tracks four engagement metrics, all visible on the public hub page, profile pages, and the Explore leaderboard:

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Views** | Non-owner page loads (every QR scan or link visit counts) |
| **Hearts** | Logged-in non-owners who tapped the heart in the visitor bar |
| **Saves** | Logged-in non-owners who saved the hub to their dashboard |
| **Shares** | Clicks on the Share button (native share sheet on mobile, clipboard copy on desktop) |

Owners see their hub's heart and save counts on each hub card in the dashboard. Views and shares appear on the profile page and Explore leaderboard.

---

## Profiles

Every user has a public profile page at `/h/[username]` showing their public hubs and earned badges.

**Editing your profile:** Open the dashboard ⚙ Settings gear → **Edit Profile**, or click **Edit Profile** when viewing your own profile page. You can set:
- **Display name** — shown above your `@username` on your profile
- **Bio** — one or two lines about you or your hubs (160 characters)
- **Profile photo** — upload from your device
- **Social links** — up to 5 links with custom labels (Website, Instagram, etc.)

Your `@username` is permanent — it is encoded in every QR code you've ever printed and cannot be changed.

## Explore & Leaderboard

`/explore` — Browse all public hubs across the community.

- **Top Hubs leaderboard** — shown at the top when any hub has engagement data; 4 panels (Most Viewed, Most Hearted, Most Saved, Most Shared), each listing the top 5 hubs with their counts
- **Template filter** — click a category pill to filter the hub grid by template type
- **Hub grid** — most recently updated public hubs, sorted by `updated_at`
- **@username links** — each hub card links to its creator's profile page

The leaderboard populates automatically once the engagement metrics SQL migrations have been run.

---

## Block types

| Type | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `text` | Written notes, reflections, instructions. Supports optional label and date. Whitespace-preserved. |
| `checklist` | Tap-to-complete list. Checked state stored in **browser localStorage** (per-device, not DB). "Begin again" resets. |
| `audio` | Embedded audio player for any hosted URL. Optional label and recording date. |
| `link` | Tappable row linking to an external URL. Opens in new tab. |
| `phone` | Tap-to-call row. Opens device dialer. |
| `file` | Downloadable file from any public URL. |
| `image` | Inline photo from any public URL. Optional caption. |
| `timeline` | Vertical sequence of dated events with accent-color dot markers. |
| `collection_menu` | Public button menu of hubs from a collection. Data: `{ collection_id, excluded_hub_ids[] }`. Renders via `collectionHubs` prop pre-fetched server-side in page.tsx. |

### Data shape per block type

All blocks are stored in `content_blocks` as `type` + `data` (JSONB) + `sort_order`.

```json
// text
{ "label": "Product Overview", "text": "...", "date": "2026-05-25" }

// checklist
{ "label": "Setup Steps", "items": [{ "id": "s-1", "text": "Step one" }] }

// audio
{ "label": "Welcome Message", "url": "https://...", "date": "2026-05-25" }

// link
{ "label": "Product Page", "url": "https://example.com/..." }

```

## Dashboard & collections

The dashboard (`/dashboard`) shows your collections at the top and your hubs below, sorted by most recently updated.

**Collections:**
- Collections appear as expandable cards above the hub list — always visible, no accordion toggle.
- Click a collection card to select it; the hub list below filters to show only that collection's hubs. Click again to deselect (or use **Show all hubs ×** in the Collections header).
- When a collection is selected, its description appears on the card. Add or edit a description via the collection's ⋮ menu → Edit.
- The ⋮ button on each collection card: **+ Add hub** (creates a hub pre-assigned to that collection), **Edit** (rename + set description), **Delete**.
- A default "My Hubs" collection is created automatically on first login if you have none.
- Create a new collection with the **+ New collection** dashed button at the bottom of the collection list.

**Hub cards:**
- Click anywhere on a hub card to open the edit page.
- The ⋮ button opens a menu: **Edit**, **View** (opens public page), **Copy link**, **Download QR**, **Print card**, **Move to collection**.
- Tags appear at the bottom-left of the card and are clickable to filter the hub list by that tag.
- The updated date appears bottom-right on each card. A small ♥ count appears next to the date if the hub has received hearts.

**Saved Hubs section:**
- Appears below the hub list when the user has saved any Hubs from other people.
- Each saved Hub card shows the hub title, owner `@username`, template badge, collection assignment, and an **Updated** badge when the hub has changed since last view.
- Clicking a saved Hub card opens the public Hub page (not the edit page — saved Hubs are not editable).
- The ⋮ menu on a saved Hub card: **View Hub**, **Remove from Saved**, **Move to Collection** (a collection assignment selector).

**Assigning a hub to a collection:**
- At creation time: a Collection selector appears in the hub creation form.
- After creation: open the hub card's ⋮ menu → **Move to collection**.
- In hub Settings tab: full Collection dropdown.

**Hub type badge:**
- When creating a hub from a template, the template name (e.g. "🐾 Pet Profile") appears as a badge on the dashboard card.
- For hubs created from Blank, or to re-label any hub, go to the hub's **Settings tab → Hub type** dropdown. Changing this adds the badge only — it does not add or remove content blocks.

## Saving & social features

### Saving a Hub

Any logged-in user can save a Hub that belongs to someone else. To save: visit a public or unlisted Hub (not your own), then tap **Save Hub** in the bar at the top of the page. The button changes to **✓ Saved**. Tap again to remove it.

If you are not signed in when you tap Save Hub, you will be redirected to `/login?next=…` and returned to the Hub after signing in.

Private Hubs cannot be saved — only the owner can view them.

Saved Hubs appear in a dedicated **Saved Hubs** section at the bottom of the dashboard, visually distinct from owned Hubs, showing the owner's `@username`. They link to the public Hub page — they cannot be edited.

**Organizing saved Hubs:** Open the ⋮ menu on a saved Hub card and choose **Move to Collection** to assign it to any of your own Collections. Saved Hubs assigned to a collection also appear in **Hub Collector** (`collection_menu`) blocks on your own public Hubs — the same way owned Hubs do.

### Updated badge

When a saved Hub is updated (content blocks added, removed, or edited; or hub settings changed) since your last visit, a blue **Updated** badge appears on the saved Hub card in your dashboard. Visiting the Hub page clears the badge automatically.

Internally, `saved_hubs.last_viewed_at` is set server-side on each page load; the badge shows when `hubs.updated_at > last_viewed_at`.

### Hearts

Logged-in non-owners can heart any public or unlisted Hub by tapping the heart icon (♡) in the visitor bar at the top of the public Hub page. Tapping again removes the heart. The total heart count is visible to all visitors, including those not signed in.

Hub owners see the heart count for each of their Hubs on the dashboard Hub card — a small ♥ count next to the updated date at the bottom-right of the card.

### Visitor bar

Non-owners (both logged-in and logged-out) see a persistent bar at the top of every public/unlisted Hub page containing:
- **Left:** heart icon + count (always visible; interactive toggle for logged-in non-owners)
- **Right:** Save Hub / ✓ Saved button

Owners see their existing **Your Hub** bar with the Edit button instead.

---

## Styled quote / passage text

Any `text` block whose label contains one of these words renders in **italic** with a thin accent-colored left border — useful for quotes, poetry, featured passages, spoken text, or any content that should feel set apart from body copy:

```
invocation  |  words to speak  |  quote  |  passage  |  poem  |  prayer  |  sacred
```

Matching is case-insensitive and partial (`isCeremonial()` in `components/HubView.tsx`).

---

## Default collapse state

On the public hub view, every block is collapsible. The initial open/closed state when the page loads is determined by keyword matching against the block's label (`defaultOpen()` in `components/HubView.tsx`):

| State | Label contains |
|-------|---------------|
| Open by default | `overview`, `step`, `note`, `invocation`, `words` |
| Closed by default | `setup`, `correspond`, `photo`, `memor`, `follow`, `playlist`, `voice` |
| Open (fallback) | everything else |

Matching is case-insensitive and partial (`l.includes(...)`). A label not matching any keyword defaults to open.

To control the collapse state of any block, include or avoid the relevant keyword in its label. For example, naming a block "Ritual Setup" starts it closed (matches `setup`); naming it "Ritual Steps" starts it open (matches `step`).

---

### Hub Collector (`hub_collector`)
Pre-fills: title "My Hub Collection", blue theme (`#3B82F6`).  
Creates **2 content blocks** via `Promise.all` to the API route.

| # | Label | Type | Notes |
|---|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Introduction | text | Empty — optional intro text above the hub menu |
| 2 | Hub Menu | collection_menu | `collection_id` empty — user selects a collection in the block editor |

**Architecture:** `collection_menu` blocks store `{ collection_id, excluded_hub_ids[] }` in JSONB. The server component (`page.tsx`) pre-fetches hubs for each `collection_menu` block and passes them to `HubView` via `collectionHubs: Record<string, any[]>` keyed by block ID. Opt-out model: all hubs in the collection appear by default; user unchecks to exclude. RLS filters private hubs automatically for non-owners. Multiple `collection_menu` blocks in one hub = multiple separate menus.

**Privacy notes in editor:** Private hubs show an amber warning; unlisted hubs show a gray label. These labels are for the owner's awareness only — on the public view, RLS handles filtering.

## Public view design notes

**File:** `components/HubView.tsx` (client component)  
**Page:** `app/h/[slug]/page.tsx` (server component — fetches data, passes props to HubView)

- Background: `#FAF9F7` (warm cream)
- Stone color palette throughout (`stone-*` classes)
- Blocks render as hairline-separated rows (`divide-y divide-stone-100`), not stacked cards
- Collapsed: `text-sm font-medium text-stone-500`, `py-3`, quiet
- Expanded: `font-semibold text-stone-800`, content indented `pl-6`
- Checklist: 8px circle bullets (no checkbox box)
- Link/phone/file: quiet text rows with small accent icon + arrow, no button styling
- Image blocks: edge-to-edge within column, `rounded-xl`
- Timeline: thin accent-color vertical line, tiny dots with box-shadow ring

## Adding a new template

1. Add an entry to `TEMPLATES` array in `components/HubForm.tsx`
2. Define a `YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` const (follow `RECIPE_BLOCKS` as a simple pattern) — place it **before** `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` to avoid TypeScript forward-reference errors
3. Add `your_id: YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` to the `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` record
4. Add a tag placeholder string to `TAG_PLACEHOLDERS` record
5. Add audio suggestions array to `AUDIO_SUGGESTIONS` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`
6. Add checklist label placeholder to `CHECKLIST_LABEL_PLACEHOLDER` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`

Block inserts run automatically via `handleSubmit` — no per-template branching. All inserts go through `fetch('/api/hub/${newHub.id}/content_blocks', { method: 'POST' })` due to RLS requiring server-side auth context.

## Content block indicators

In the block editor, each block row shows a small dot on the left:
- **Solid green dot** — the block has content (text entered, URL filled, items or events added)
- **Hollow gray ring** — the block is empty
- Empty block rows also render on a light gray background as an additional visual cue

This makes it easy to scan the editor and see what still needs to be filled in after applying a template.

## Known issues / deferred

- **Sort order gaps**: If a block insert fails (e.g., during bulk template creation), sort_order numbering can have gaps. When two blocks share the same sort_order, `moveBlock()` swaps equal values and does nothing. Fix: normalize sort_orders after every move (reassign 0,1,2,… from array position). Deferred — only manifests after a failed partial template insert.
- **Free tier limits**: Hub and collection limits not yet enforced.
- **Image uploads**: Supported directly from the image block editor. Uploaded files are stored in Supabase Storage. A public URL can also be pasted instead.
- **Email login / signup**: Both are grayed out pending SMTP configuration. Only Google OAuth is active.
