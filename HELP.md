# QRMagNotes — Help & Reference

## How it works

Each hub has a permanent URL at `/h/[slug]`. You print a QR code pointing to that URL and attach it to something physical — a product, an artwork, a piece of equipment, a property, a vehicle, or any physical space. The content behind the QR can be updated at any time without reprinting.

**Hub modes:**
- `landing` — Shows a content page with blocks
- `redirect` — Instantly sends visitors to another URL (no page shown)

**Privacy levels:**
- `public` — Anyone can find and view
- `unlisted` — Only people with the link can view
- `private` — Only the owner when signed in

---

## Block types

| Type | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `text` | Written notes, reflections, instructions. Supports optional label and date. Whitespace-preserved. |
| `checklist` | Tap-to-complete list. Checked state stored in **browser localStorage** (per-device, not DB). "Begin again" resets. |
| `audio` | Embedded audio player for any hosted URL. Optional label and recording date. |
| `link` | Tappable row linking to an external URL. Opens in new tab. |
| `phone` | Tap-to-call row. Opens device dialer. |
| `file` | Downloadable file from any public URL. |
| `image` | Inline photo from any public URL. Optional caption. |
| `timeline` | Vertical sequence of dated events with accent-color dot markers. |

### Data shape per block type

All blocks are stored in `content_blocks` as `type` + `data` (JSONB) + `sort_order`.

```json
// text
{ "label": "Product Overview", "text": "...", "date": "2026-05-25" }

// checklist
{ "label": "Setup Steps", "items": [{ "id": "s-1", "text": "Step one" }] }

// audio
{ "label": "Welcome Message", "url": "https://...", "date": "2026-05-25" }

// link
{ "label": "Product Page", "url": "https://example.com/..." }

// phone
{ "label": "Support Line", "url": "+1-555-000-0000" }

// file
{ "label": "User Manual", "url": "https://..." }

// image
{ "url": "https://...", "caption": "Product photo" }

// timeline
{ "label": "Service History", "events": [{ "id": "e1", "date": "2024-01-15", "text": "Oil change" }] }
```

## Dashboard & folders

The dashboard (`/dashboard`) shows all your hubs as a flat list sorted by most recently updated. Above the list is a collapsible **Folders** section.

**Folders:**
- Click **▼ Show** to expand the Folders section; each folder row shows a name and hub count.
- Click a folder name to filter the flat list to only that folder's hubs. A blue banner appears showing the active folder; click **Show all ×** to clear.
- Use **+ Hub** on any folder row to create a new hub pre-assigned to that folder.
- A default "My Hubs" folder is created automatically on first login if you have none.

**Assigning a hub to a folder:**
- At creation time: a Folder selector appears right after the slug field.
- After creation: each hub card has a small `📁 folder name` dropdown — tap it to move the hub without going into Settings.
- In hub Settings tab: full Folder dropdown with a **+ New** button to create a folder inline.

**Hub type badge:**
- When creating a hub from a template, the template name (e.g. "🐾 Pet Profile") appears as a badge on the dashboard card.
- For hubs created from Blank, or to re-label any hub, go to the hub's **Settings tab → Hub type** dropdown. Changing this adds the badge only — it does not add or remove content blocks.

## Styled quote / passage text

Any `text` block whose label contains one of these words renders in **italic** with a thin accent-colored left border — useful for quotes, poetry, featured passages, spoken text, or any content that should feel set apart from body copy:

```
invocation  |  words to speak  |  quote  |  passage  |  poem  |  prayer  |  sacred
```

Matching is case-insensitive and partial (`isCeremonial()` in `components/HubView.tsx`).

---

## Default collapse state

On the public hub view, every block is collapsible. The initial open/closed state when the page loads is determined by keyword matching against the block's label (`defaultOpen()` in `components/HubView.tsx`):

| State | Label contains |
|-------|---------------|
| Open by default | `overview`, `step`, `note`, `invocation`, `words` |
| Closed by default | `setup`, `correspond`, `photo`, `memor`, `follow`, `playlist`, `voice` |
| Open (fallback) | everything else |

Matching is case-insensitive and partial (`l.includes(...)`). A label not matching any keyword defaults to open.

To control the collapse state of any block, include or avoid the relevant keyword in its label. For example, naming a block "Ritual Setup" starts it closed (matches `setup`); naming it "Ritual Steps" starts it open (matches `step`).

## Public view design notes

**File:** `components/HubView.tsx` (client component)  
**Page:** `app/h/[slug]/page.tsx` (server component — fetches data, passes props to HubView)

- Background: `#FAF9F7` (warm cream)
- Stone color palette throughout (`stone-*` classes)
- Blocks render as hairline-separated rows (`divide-y divide-stone-100`), not stacked cards
- Collapsed: `text-sm font-medium text-stone-500`, `py-3`, quiet
- Expanded: `font-semibold text-stone-800`, content indented `pl-6`
- Checklist: 8px circle bullets (no checkbox box)
- Link/phone/file: quiet text rows with small accent icon + arrow, no button styling
- Image blocks: edge-to-edge within column, `rounded-xl`
- Timeline: thin accent-color vertical line, tiny dots with box-shadow ring

---

## Adding a new template

1. Add an entry to `TEMPLATES` array in `components/HubForm.tsx`
2. Define a `YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` const (follow `RECIPE_BLOCKS` as a simple pattern) — place it **before** `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` to avoid TypeScript forward-reference errors
3. Add `your_id: YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` to the `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` record
4. Add a tag placeholder string to `TAG_PLACEHOLDERS` record
5. Add audio suggestions array to `AUDIO_SUGGESTIONS` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`
6. Add checklist label placeholder to `CHECKLIST_LABEL_PLACEHOLDER` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`

Block inserts run automatically via `handleSubmit` — no per-template branching. All inserts go through `fetch('/api/hub/${newHub.id}/content_blocks', { method: 'POST' })` due to RLS requiring server-side auth context.

---

## Content block indicators

In the block editor, each block row shows a small dot on the left:
- **Solid green dot** — the block has content (text entered, URL filled, items or events added)
- **Hollow gray ring** — the block is empty
- Empty block rows also render on a light gray background as an additional visual cue

This makes it easy to scan the editor and see what still needs to be filled in after applying a template.

---

## Known issues / deferred

- **Sort order gaps**: If a block insert fails (e.g., during bulk template creation), sort_order numbering can have gaps. When two blocks share the same sort_order, `moveBlock()` swaps equal values and does nothing. Fix: normalize sort_orders after every move (reassign 0,1,2,… from array position). Deferred — only manifests after a failed partial template insert.
- **Multi-user slugs**: Current URL is `/h/[slug]`. Future plan: `/h/[username]/[slug]` for multi-tenant. Deferred until before real users print QR codes.
- **Free tier limits**: Hub and folder limits not yet enforced.
- **Image uploads**: Supported directly from the image block editor. Uploaded files are stored in Supabase Storage. A public URL can also be pasted instead.
