# HubCollector

A QR-code hub platform for attaching evolving digital content to physical objects, spaces, and experiences. A user creates a hub with a stable URL (`/h/[slug]`), prints the QR code, and places it on something physical. The content behind the QR can be updated at any time without reprinting.

Targeting household, creative, ritual, and eventually business use cases (property records, customer hubs, product pages). Help content must stay template-agnostic — generic across all use cases, not ritual-specific.

## Stack

```

## Database

Tables — all with RLS enabled:
- **profiles** — auto-created via trigger on `auth.users` insert
- **hubs** — owned by user; publicly readable for `/h/[slug]`; columns include `collection_id` (FK → collections), `privacy_mode`, `tags text[]`, `template_id text`
- **collections** — user-owned folders; hubs.collection_id references this
- **content_blocks** — belongs to hub; type + data (JSONB) + sort_order
- **saved_hubs** — user saves another user's hub; columns: `user_id`, `hub_id`, `collection_id` (FK → collections, nullable), `last_viewed_at` (timestamptz); UNIQUE(user_id, hub_id); RLS: users manage their own rows; a second SELECT policy allows public reads of collection-assigned non-private saved hubs (for Hub Collector pages)
- **hub_hearts** — user hearts a hub; columns: `user_id`, `hub_id`; UNIQUE(user_id, hub_id); RLS: anyone can read (SELECT USING true); only the user can insert/delete their own hearts

`hub_links` table has been fully removed. All content is now in `content_blocks`.

### content_blocks type constraint

```sql
type text not null check (type in ('text', 'image', 'audio', 'file', 'link', 'phone', 'checklist', 'timeline', 'note', 'collection_menu'))
```

If this constraint is wrong in your Supabase instance, fix it:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.content_blocks DROP CONSTRAINT content_blocks_type_check;
ALTER TABLE public.content_blocks ADD CONSTRAINT content_blocks_type_check
  CHECK (type IN ('text', 'image', 'audio', 'file', 'link', 'phone', 'checklist', 'timeline', 'note', 'collection_menu'));
```

### RLS for content_blocks

Block inserts/updates **must go through the API routes** (`/api/hub/[hubId]/content_blocks`), not direct Supabase client calls. RLS requires server-side auth context; direct client inserts fail silently.

## Core concepts

**Hub modes:**
- `landing` — shows the public content page (HubView); labelled **"Interactive Page"** in both create and edit UI (was "Landing Page" in create mode — corrected for consistency)
- `redirect` — instantly redirects to `redirect_url`; labelled **"Redirect Link"** in the UI; destination URL field appears inline immediately below the mode buttons, not at the bottom of the form

New hubs default to `private` visibility.

**Privacy:**
- `public` — anyone can find and view
- `unlisted` — only people with the link can view
- `private` — only the owner when signed in (others see a lock screen)

**Hub type (`template_id`):**
Stored as a text column on hubs. Set automatically when a hub is created from a template. Can also be set retroactively in the hub's Settings tab → "Hub type" dropdown — this only adds the badge label on the dashboard card; it does not add or remove content blocks.

**Collections:**
- User-facing label is "Collection/Collections". DB table is still `collections`; FK is still `collection_id`.
- Dashboard shows collection cards above the hub list (always visible, not in an accordion).
- Clicking a card selects it and filters the hub list below to that collection; clicking again deselects.
- Description (optional) appears on the card only when it is the active/selected collection.
- Collection ⋮ kebab: + Add hub, Edit (name + description), Delete.
- Hub assignment is done via the hub card's ⋮ kebab → "Move to collection" (no inline select on the card).
- First login auto-creates a "My Hubs" collection if the user has none.

The QR code always points to `/h/[username]/[slug]`. The slug is permanent — changing it breaks printed QR codes. The username is derived from the user's email prefix and stored on the `profiles` table.

## Content blocks

Each block has `type`, `data` (JSONB), and `sort_order`. Supported types:

| Type | Data shape |
|------|-----------|
| `text` | `{ label, text, date? }` |
| `checklist` | `{ label, items: [{ id, text }] }` |
| `audio` | `{ label, url, date? }` |
| `link` | `{ label, url }` |
| `phone` | `{ label, url }` |
| `file` | `{ label, url }` |
| `image` | `{ url, caption }` |
| `timeline` | `{ label, events: [{ id, date, text }] }` |
| `collection_menu` | `{ collection_id: string, excluded_hub_ids: string[] }` |

## Public view (HubView.tsx)

`app/h/[username]/[slug]/page.tsx` is a server component that looks up the profile by username, then the hub by user_id + slug, and passes props to `HubView`. It also:
- Pre-fetches `collectionHubs: Record<string, any[]>` (keyed by block ID) for any `collection_menu` blocks — including saved hubs the page owner has assigned to each collection (owner_username attached to each hub for correct public URL generation)
- Fetches `heartCount` (visible to all), `isSaved`, and `userHearted` for the current visitor
- Updates `saved_hubs.last_viewed_at` (best-effort await) when a logged-in non-owner who has saved the hub visits the page

All interactive rendering is in `components/HubView.tsx` (client component). HubView never fetches hub data directly.

**HubView visitor bar:** shown for non-owners (both logged-in and logged-out); sticky top bar with heart toggle + count on the left and Save Hub / ✓ Saved button on the right. Clicking either while logged out redirects to `/login?next=…`.

**Design system:**
- Background: `#FAF9F7` (warm cream) via `bg-[#FAF9F7]`
- Stone color palette throughout (`stone-*`)
- Blocks render as `divide-y divide-stone-100` hairline-separated rows — no stacked cards
- Collapsed sections: `py-3 text-sm font-medium text-stone-500`
- Expanded sections: `font-semibold text-stone-800`, content indented `pl-6`
- Checklist: 8px circle bullets (no checkbox box); `begin again` resets
- Link/phone/file: quiet text rows with small accent-opacity icon + arrow
- Image: edge-to-edge `rounded-xl`, no card wrapper
- Timeline: thin accent-color left border, tiny dot with `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #FAF9F7` ring

**Ceremonial/styled text (`isCeremonial()`):**
Any `text` block whose label contains `invocation`, `words to speak`, `quote`, `passage`, `poem`, `prayer`, or `sacred` renders in italic with a thin accent-color left border.

**Default collapse state (`defaultOpen()`):**
- Open: label contains `overview`, `step`, `note`, `invocation`, `words`
- Closed: label contains `setup`, `correspond`, `photo`, `memor`, `follow`, `playlist`, `voice`
- All others: open by default

## Templates

Defined in `TEMPLATES` array in `components/HubForm.tsx`. Template picker shown before create form. All blocks are created via `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` record in `handleSubmit` — no per-template branching needed.

**20 templates (alphabetical, Blank first):** Blank, Artwork Archive (8 blocks), Book / Reading Notes (7 blocks), Daily Reflection / Journal (10 blocks), Diary / Life Log (10 blocks), Garden Planner (9 blocks), Goal / Habit Tracker (6 blocks), Grocery List (10 blocks), Home Maintenance Log (8 blocks), Hub Collector (2 blocks), Pet Profile (8 blocks), Plant Profile (8 blocks), Recipe (8 blocks), Ritual (14 blocks), Shadow Work Journal (12 blocks), Travel Journal (7 blocks), Travel Packing List (11 blocks), Vehicle Maintenance (9 blocks), What's in the Box? (8 blocks), Workout Tracker (8 blocks).

See `HELP.md` for the full block-by-block breakdown of each template.

### Adding a new template
1. Add an entry to `TEMPLATES` in `components/HubForm.tsx`
2. Define a `YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` const (follow `RITUAL_BLOCKS` or `RECIPE_BLOCKS` as pattern) — place it **before** `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` to avoid forward-reference errors
3. Add `your_id: YOUR_TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` to the `BLOCKS_BY_TEMPLATE` record
4. Add a tag placeholder to `TAG_PLACEHOLDERS` record
5. Add audio label suggestions to `AUDIO_SUGGESTIONS` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`
6. Add checklist label placeholder to `CHECKLIST_LABEL_PLACEHOLDER` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx`
7. Add an entry to the `TEMPLATES` array in `app/help/page.tsx` — include `templateId` (must match the id in HubForm), `name`, `emoji`, `tagline`, `description`, `borderClass`, and `blocks` array (for the lightbox modal)
8. Add a matching entry to `TEMPLATE_LABELS` in `components/HubCard.tsx`
9. All block inserts use `fetch('/api/hub/${newHub.id}/content_blocks', { method: 'POST' })` automatically via the map in `handleSubmit`

## Sort order

`moveBlock()` in `ContentBlocksEditor.tsx` swaps by array index and normalizes all sort_orders to `0, 1, 2, …` on every move. This heals gaps or duplicates from partial template inserts. Only changed blocks are PATCHed.

New blocks are inserted with `sort_order: blocks.length`.

## Dashboard

**File:** `app/dashboard/collections/page.tsx` (client component)

- Background: `bg-[#FAF9F7]` (warm cream, matches public hub view)
- Header: HubCollector™ logo + bordered **Help** button + ⚙ **Settings gear** dropdown (contains Sign out; future settings items go here)
- Stats line: `X Hubs · X Collections` above the `+ New Hub` CTA
- **WelcomeCard** renders below stats (see WelcomeCard section)
- **Collections** section: folder SVG icon + `text-sm font-semibold`; empty collections show `empty` in muted italic instead of `0 Hubs`
- **Search & filters** (search input + All modes + All visibility dropdowns): placed **below Collections**, directly above the hub list — they filter the list they're adjacent to
- **Hub list** sorted alphabetically A→Z by `title` (DB query uses `.order('title', { ascending: true })`)
- **All Hubs** section header: grid SVG icon + `text-sm font-semibold`
- **Saved Hubs section**: rendered below the owned hub list; only shown when the user has saved hubs; uses `SavedHubCard`; loads via parallel query in `fetchData`; also loads owner usernames (separate profiles query) and heart counts for owned hubs
- **Heart counts**: loaded for all owned hubs and passed as `heartCount` prop to `HubCard`; displayed as ♥ N in bottom-right of card when > 0

## WelcomeCard

**File:** `components/WelcomeCard.tsx` — founder onboarding card on the dashboard.

**localStorage key:** `hc_dismissed_cards` — JSON array of dismissed card keys. Each card has a unique key; dismissed cards never reappear unless the key changes.

**Two types of cards (priority: journey first, then feature):**

**Journey cards** — shown based on current `hubCount`, one at a time, until dismissed or naturally outgrown:
| Key | Condition | Message |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `journey-welcome-v1` | hubCount === 0 | "Hi, I'm Christine" — founder intro with photo |
| `journey-first-hub-v1` | hubCount === 1 | "You've created your first Hub" — suggests printing QR |
| `journey-growing-v1` | hubCount >= 2 | "You're building something" — suggests Collections |
| `journey-established-v1` | hubCount >= 4 | "You've got the hang of it" — closing message |

**Feature cards** — add a new entry to `FEATURE_CARDS` array in `WelcomeCard.tsx` when shipping a notable feature. Shows to all users with ≥ 1 Hub who haven't dismissed that key. Bump the key version suffix (`v2`) to re-surface an updated announcement.

All cards have an × dismiss button. Founder photo: `/public/Christine.jpg` (circular avatar, `object-top` crop). Falls back to teal "C" initial if photo missing.

## HubForm edit mode

Edit page (`app/dashboard/hub/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) uses Content / Settings tabs. **Delete hub has been removed from the edit page header** — it lives in the Settings tab at the bottom in a "Danger zone" section (renders `<DeleteHubForm hubId={hub.id} />`).

Content tab renders `<ContentBlocksEditor hubId={hub.id} hubTitle={hub.title} />`. Settings tab has all hub fields: Collection, Hub type (template_id dropdown), title, slug, mode, visibility, tags, description, image, theme color, then danger zone.

The `✓ Saved` chip appears for 2.5s after a block is updated (`savedBlockId` state).

**`initialTemplateId` prop:** when passed to `HubForm` (from `/dashboard/hub/new?template=id`), the template picker is skipped entirely and the matching template's title, slug, description, theme color, and template_id are pre-applied as initial state. The `preselected` variable looks up the template from the `TEMPLATES` array at component initialization.

**Mode selector UX:** both create and edit modes show an explanation sentence above the buttons ("What happens when someone scans the QR code or visits this Hub's URL."). When "Redirect Link" is selected, the Destination URL input appears immediately below the mode buttons — not at the bottom of the form.

## ContentBlocksEditor

**Sequential editing flow:**
- On load, block 1 is automatically opened in edit mode (`setEditingBlockId(loaded[0].id)`)
- `openNextBlock(id)` — finds current block's index, sets `editingBlockId` to the next block, or null if at the last block
- **Save** → saves data via PATCH, then calls `openNextBlock`
- **Close** → skips saving, calls `openNextBlock` (advances without saving)
- Adding new blocks (+ Add Content Block flow) → Close just dismisses the add form; no sequential progression

**FormShell** is now a plain container (title + children only). No Cancel button.

**FormActions** component renders `[Save] [Close]` side by side — Save is primary blue, Close is bordered secondary. Used by all block forms except AudioForm (which has multiple inline save paths and a standalone Close button).

Block rows show a **content indicator dot**: solid green (`bg-emerald-400`) if the block has content, hollow gray ring (`border border-gray-300`) if empty. Empty block rows also render on `bg-gray-50` instead of white.

`blockHasContent(block)` determines this:
- `text/audio/link/phone/file` → `data.url` or `data.text` is non-empty
- `checklist` → `data.items.length > 0`
- `timeline` → `data.events.length > 0`
- `image` → `data.url` is non-empty

**Drag-and-drop reordering:**
- Uses `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable`. Each non-editing block row is wrapped in `SortableBlockRow` (defined in the same file).
- A 6-dot grip handle (`GripIcon`) is rendered at the left of each row. Drag the handle to reorder.
- `handleDragEnd` uses `arrayMove` then normalizes `sort_order` to `0,1,2,…` and PATCHes only changed blocks.
- `PointerSensor` has a 5px activation distance to prevent accidental drags on click.
- ▲▼ arrow buttons are kept for keyboard/accessibility fallback — do not remove them.

## HubCard color coding

Each hub card has a 3px colored left border using `hub.theme_color` via inline style (`style={{ borderLeft: '3px solid ${hub.theme_color}' }}`). This is intentional — dynamic colors cannot be expressed as static Tailwind classes.

`TEMPLATE_LABELS` in `HubCard.tsx` now covers all 19 non-blank templates. If a new template is added to `HubForm.tsx`, add a matching entry to `TEMPLATE_LABELS`.

## Legal pages

`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/acceptable-use`, `/content-licensing` — all exist as Next.js pages with full content. Their headers link back to **`/dashboard`** (not `/help`). If adding new legal pages, follow the same pattern: `← Dashboard` link in the header, `<SiteFooter />` at the bottom.

## Help system

- `/help` — in-app onboarding & inspiration page (no auth required), linked from dashboard header; **async server component** that checks auth; passes `templates` data and `isLoggedIn` to `HelpTemplateGrid`; template cards use static Tailwind `borderClass` strings (e.g. `border-l-blue-500`) — no inline styles
- `HelpTemplateGrid.tsx` — client component; manages `openTemplate` modal state; renders 2-col grid with "Create this Hub »" + "See blocks" per card; lightbox modal shows block table + Create CTA; `isLoggedIn` determines whether CTA links to `/dashboard/hub/new?template=id` or `/login?next=...`
- `HELP.md` — developer reference in repo root

Both files must stay template-agnostic in general sections. Template-specific content belongs only inside the per-template section.

**Navigation arrows:** all `«` Back / Dashboard and `»` forward CTAs use double guillemet Unicode characters (`«` U+00AB, `»` U+00BB). Do not use SVG chevrons or `←`/`→` Unicode arrows.

**`/help` page structure** (in order):
1. What is HubCollector? — intro + callout box
2. What people use it for — flex-wrap pill grid (15 popular uses)
3. Templates — 2-col card grid (via HelpTemplateGrid) + lightbox modal for block details; each card has "Create this Hub »" CTA and "See blocks" button
4. How hubs work — mode cards (2-col) + privacy cards (3-col)
5. Collections & Organization
6. Sharing & Social — 3 cards: Save Hub, Updated badge, Hearts
7. Block types — 2-col card grid with emoji
8. Advanced styling — ceremonial text + collapse behavior
9. Good to know — 8 tips (includes saving and hearts)

## Known Next.js 16 notes

- `middleware.ts` is renamed to `proxy.ts` and exports `proxy()` not `middleware()`
- Route params are Promises: `const { id } = await params` in server components
- `cookies()` is async: `const cookieStore = await cookies()`

## Not yet built

- SMTP configuration: both email login and email signup are grayed out in the UI pending SMTP setup. Only Google OAuth works. Configure via Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Settings → SMTP.
- Free tier enforcement (hub/collection limits)
- Paid feature: `hide_footer` flag to remove footer branding on public hubs
- Sort order normalization on load (gaps only heal on first move, not on page load)
